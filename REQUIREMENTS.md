# REQUIREMENTS.md — requirement ID scheme + traceability

## ID scheme

`<DOC>-<REV>-<CLAUSE>-<SEQ>`

- `DOC`: short document tag (e.g. `CORE`, `BDB`, `ZCL`, `GP`, `ZBD`,
  `SE`, `PRO`).
- `REV`: spec revision the requirement was extracted from (e.g.
  `R23`, `R40`, `V31`).
- `CLAUSE`: clause/section number within that revision (dots kept,
  e.g. `3.2.1`).
- `SEQ`: zero-padded sequence within the clause (e.g. `001`).

Example: `CORE-R40-3.2.1-001`.

## Traceability rule

Every requirement ID must trace both ways:

- **Up:** to its source document + revision + clause (document
  numbers and clause numbers only — never spec text, per D1).
- **Down:** to the covering page/section disposition, the
  implementing code or explicit N-A-with-cause, and the verifying
  test or sim run.

"Accounted for" vs "implemented" vs "verified" are tracked as
separate states per requirement. A spec version change reopens every
requirement sourced from the changed document.
